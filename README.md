Model Architecture:
Multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.
Flatten and Dense layers for classification.
Uses ReLU and Softmax activation functions.
Training: 10 epochs using Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
Visualization: Plot of training and validation accuracy over epochs.
Evaluation: Model achieves 99% test accuracy.
